            <h4>Purpose: To examine the relationship between tourism occupancy and average meter prices</h4>
            <h4>Insights:</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Prices are widely distributed across all levels of tourism activity.</li>
            <li>No direct linear relationship exists between them.</li>
            <li>Tourism activity is not a primary driver of real estate prices at the overall market level.</li>
            <li>There are other factors play a significant role in determining prices.</li>

            <h4>Purpose: To evaluate how different property types respond to tourism activity</h4>
            <h4>Insights:</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>The general correlation between tourism activity and real estate prices is weak.</li>
            <li>The nature of the property determines the impact of tourism.</li>
            <li>Investment properties such as villas and land are more sensitive to tourism than traditional ones.</li>

            <h2><span>Chart 3: Top Areas Based on Tourism Impact on Property Type</span></h2>
            <h4>Purpose: To identify areas where tourism activity most strongly influences specific property categories</h4>
            <h4>Insights:</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Tourism only affects specific areas with special conditions (like proximity to tourist attractions).</li>
            <li>Even in the most affected areas, tourism is not a decisive factor due to the weak correlation.</li>
            <li>We cannot assume that real estate prices will rise directly in tourist areas and they are also influenced by other factors.</li>

            <h2><span>Chart 4: Impact Distribution</span></h2>
            <h4>Purpose: To check the distribution of tourism impact across different areas and property types.</h4>
            <h4>Insights:</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>The general impact of tourism is weak to moderate, meaning it should not be considered as the only or primary driver.</li>
            <li>There is only a very small proportion of areas that are primarily tourism driven, and these are typically close to huge attractions (mainly Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall).</li>
            <li>Some areas show a negative impact from tourism, possibly due to associated factors such as noise and congestion.</li>
            <li>Tourism in Dubai has a general impact on property prices but this impact is limited to specific geographical areas and conditions, and to certain types of properties.</li>
