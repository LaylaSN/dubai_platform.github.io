      <h1><span>Key Findings</span>: </h1>
      <h2>The real estate market was studied and analyzed from multiple angles, relying on several factors:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Tourism is not the primary driver of real estate prices in the overall market, but it have a significant impact in specific geographic areas and with certain types of properties.</li>
        <li>Investment decisions should not be based only on price or location and several indicators should be considered such as tourism growth, price stability, and price attractiveness.</li>
        <li>The best investment opportunities, according to the results, are not necessarily in high price areaAreas should achieve a balance between the factors we mentioned previously.</li>
        <li>Timing analysis indicates that purchasing during certain months has more advantages than others, and the return on investment also varies depending on the season when purchase is made.</li>
        <li>Risk analysis revealed numerous risks influenced by several factors, including price volatility, liquidity, and the delayed impact of tourism activity. So purchasing in some areas holds higher risks than others.</li>
